  <excerpt>About me.</excerpt>
  <content>&lt;p&gt;My name is Ryan Baxter. I'm a computer programmer, hobbyist writer, and proud father.&amp;nbsp; Much of my career experience has come from developing business applications and integrating software systems within the manufacturing sector.&amp;nbsp; I've been the team lead on global and domestic ERP, e-commerce, and factory automation projects. I'm a developer at heart with interests including SCM, software design patterns, and programming languages. I've a love of learning and passion for technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog's breakfast is an idiom meaning, "a confused mess or mixture".&amp;nbsp; It's a fitting title for the contents herein.&amp;nbsp; This blog is a hodgepodge of posts with topics including software development, tabletop game design, home brewing, and family.&amp;nbsp; I hope you like it.&amp;nbsp; Leave comments or contact me directly.&amp;nbsp; I'd love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&amp;nbsp; I'll be adding some of my works shortly.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
